This app uses the Cocktail DB API to get information on 595 cocktail recipes. The user can get a random cocktail recipe by clicking the 'Random' button or filter by one of the following: ingredients, type of drink, type of glass for the drink, or by first letter of the drink. The user can also see how their drink compares to the other drinks in the data base in the second 'How does my drink compare?' tab which highlights the user's drink in a bar graph comparing the drink in four categories: the number of ingredients in the recipe, the type of glass it uses, the type of drink, and by first letter of the drink recipe.
